## Sparse - A light-weigth Vector Engine

Sparse is a project of mine that I created from scratch using python and a bit of mathematics, It's not something major or ground-breaking yet but I'd like if people come toghether and build on top of this to make it like an actual database that works.

Will post documentation soon...
